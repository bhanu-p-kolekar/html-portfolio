<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a third-year BTech student specializing in Computer Science and Engineering, with a growing interest in full-stack development, problem-solving, and modern technologies shaping the digital world. Having completed the foundational years of my engineering journey, I have built a strong base in core subjects such as data structures, algorithms, computer networks, and object-oriented programming. These have helped me develop a logical and structured approach to solving real-world technical problems.</p>

<p>Currently, I am actively expanding my skill set in web development and programming. I have practical experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m steadily progressing into backend technologies and full-stack frameworks. I’ve been working on building dynamic, user-centric applications while becoming proficient with tools like Git, VS Code, and other collaborative platforms that are essential in industry workflows. This stage of my degree has also allowed me to explore hands-on coding, project building, and understanding how different layers of technology come together.</p>

<p>Beyond coursework, I am continuously upskilling through online platforms and real-time practice to stay aligned with industry expectations. I am particularly interested in areas like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing, and I intend to explore these domains more deeply during the remainder of my degree. I’m also planning to take on internships and team-based projects that will enhance my practical understanding of technology in professional environments.</p>

<p>With a strong academic foundation and a proactive approach to learning, I aim to become an industry-ready software engineer by the end of my degree. My current focus is to gain practical exposure, contribute to impactful projects, and position myself for exciting opportunities in leading tech companies by the time I graduate.</p>
